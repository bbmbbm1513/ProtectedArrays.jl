## Features

- **Immutability**: Once created, the arrays cannot be modified. This ensures data integrity and prevents accidental changes.
- **Performance**: Designed for speed, this package minimizes overhead while maintaining safety.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Julia code and libraries.
- **Simple API**: Intuitive functions and methods make it easy to get started.

## Installation

To install **ProtectedArrays.jl**, use the Julia package manager. Run the following command in your Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ProtectedArrays")
```

## Usage

Using **ProtectedArrays.jl** is straightforward. Here’s how to create a protected array:

```julia
using ProtectedArrays

# Create a protected array
protected_array = ProtectedArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

Once created, you cannot modify `protected_array`. Any attempt to change its contents will result in an error, ensuring your data remains unchanged.

### Accessing Elements

You can access elements in a protected array just like a regular array:

```julia
first_element = protected_array[1]  # Returns 1
```

### Iteration

You can iterate over the elements in a protected array:

```julia
for element in protected_array
    println(element)
end
```

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of how to use **ProtectedArrays.jl** in your projects.

### Example 1: Protecting Configuration Data

When dealing with configuration settings, it’s crucial to ensure that they do not change unexpectedly. Here’s how to use **ProtectedArrays.jl** for that purpose:

```julia
config = ProtectedArray([10, 20, 30, 40])

# Attempting to modify will raise an error
# config[1] = 100  # This will fail
```

### Example 2: Ensuring Data Integrity in Calculations

In scientific computing, you often need to ensure that input data remains constant throughout calculations. Here’s how to do that:

```julia
data = ProtectedArray([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Use data in calculations
result = sum(data)  # Returns 6.0
```
